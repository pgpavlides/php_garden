# 1.Introduction

### 1.1 Why PHP <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/PHP-logo.svg/2560px-PHP-logo.svg.png" alt="image-description" height="33px">

PHP is a popular, open-source web development language, known for its ease of learning, cross-platform compatibility, and rich ecosystem of tools, libraries, and frameworks. With a large, supportive community and extensive documentation, PHP enables developers to build dynamic web applications quickly and efficiently. The language's built-in web features, mature nature, and continuous performance improvements make it a versatile and reliable choice for various web projects. PHP's flexibility in integration with databases, web servers, and other technologies further enhances its appeal for developers.

### 1.2 Brief history of PHP? <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/2132/2132336.png" alt="image-description" height="40px" width="40px">

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language that is widely used for web development. It was created in 1994 by [Rasmus Lerdorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf), a Danish-Canadian programmer, as a set of Common Gateway Interface [CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) scripts to keep track of visitors to his personal website. Over time, Lerdorf extended the language and eventually released it as open-source software, which allowed others to contribute to its development.

In the late 1990s, two developers, [Andi Gutmans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andi_Gutmans) and [Zeev Suraski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeev_Suraski), rewrote the language's core, creating a more robust and efficient version of PHP. This version, known as PHP 3, was released in 1998 and became very popular among web developers.

Over the years, PHP has continued to evolve and improve, with the release of new versions that added new features and improved performance. The latest version of PHP, PHP 8, was released in November 2020 and includes features such as named arguments, union types, and attributes.

Today, PHP is used by millions of websites and is supported by a large and active community of developers. It is one of the most popular scripting languages for web development and is used to build dynamic and interactive websites, e-commerce sites, content management systems, and more.

# 3 Variables and Data Types

### 3.1 Variables

All variables in PHP must be declared with a **leading dollar sign ($)**. For example, a string variable named "message" would be declared as follows:

```php
$message = "Hello, world!";
```



It's important to note that in PHP, variables are **dynamically typed**, which means that the type of a variable can change at runtime based on the value assigned to it.



- **Scalar variables**: These are variables that can hold a single value, such as an integer, float, string, or boolean.

```php
$integer = 42;
$float = 3.14;
$string = "Hello, world!";
$boolean = true;
```

- **Array variables**: These are variables that can hold multiple values, indexed either numerically or associatively.

```php
$numbers = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
$associative_array = array("one" => 1, "two" => 2, "three" => 3);
```

- **Object variables**: These are variables that hold instances of classes, which can contain both data and behavior.

```php
class Car {
    public $make;
    public $model;
    public $year;
}

$my_car = new Car();
$my_car->make = "Toyota";
$my_car->model = "Camry";
$my_car->year = 2020;
```

- **Resource variables**: These are special variables that hold references to resources external to PHP, such as database connections or file handles.

```php
$file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
$database = mysqli_connect("localhost", "user", "password", "database");
```

- **NULL variables**: These are variables that have no value assigned to them.
```php
$null_variable = null;
```

### 3.2 Data types

- **Integers**: Represent whole numbers, such as 42 or -123.

```php
$a = 42;
$b = -123;
```

- **Floats**: Represent numbers with decimal places, such as 3.14 or -0.01.

```php
$c = 3.14;
$d = -0.01;
```

- **Strings**: Represent sequences of characters, such as "Hello, world!" or "php".
```php
$e = "Hello, world!";
$f = "php";
```


- **Booleans**: Represent truth values, either true or false.

```php
$g = true;
$h = false;
```

- **Arrays**: Represent ordered collections of values, either indexed by numbers (called numeric arrays) or by strings (called associative arrays).

```php
$numbers = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
$associative_array = array("one" => 1, "two" => 2, "three" => 3);
```

- **Objects**: Represent instances of classes, which can contain both data and behavior.

```php
class Car {
    public $make;
    public $model;
    public $year;
}

$my_car = new Car();
$my_car->make = "Toyota";
$my_car->model = "Camry";
$my_car->year = 2020;
```

- **Resources**: Represent external resources, such as database connections or file handles.

```php
$file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
$database = mysqli_connect("localhost", "user", "password", "database");
```

- **NULL**: Represent the absence of a value.

```php
$null_variable = null;
```

### 3.3 Type Casting

In PHP, type casting refers to the process of converting a value from one data type to another. This is sometimes necessary when working with values of different data types, such as when you need to perform arithmetic with a string that contains a number.

Type casting in PHP can be done either explicitly or implicitly. Explicit type casting is performed using type casting functions, such as (**int**), (**float**), (**string**), and (**bool**). For example:

```php
$a = (int) "42"; // $a will be an integer with the value 42
$b = (float) "3.14"; // $b will be a float with the value 3.14
$c = (string) 42; // $c will be a string with the value "42"
$d = (bool) 0; // $d will be a boolean with the value false
```

Implicit type casting occurs automatically in certain situations, such as when a value is used in a context that requires a different data type. For example:

```php
$a = 42;
$b = $a + 0.5; // $b will be a float with the value 42.5
$c = "42";
$d = $c + 0; // $d will be an integer with the value 42
```

It's important to be mindful of the data types of values when performing type casting, as the results of the conversion may not always be what you expect. For example, when casting a float to an integer, the fractional part of the float will be truncated, not rounded. When casting a string to a boolean, the string "false" (not including quotes) will be cast to false, while all other strings will be cast to true.

### 3.4 Constants

In PHP, constants are values that cannot be changed after they have been defined. Constants are typically used to represent values that don't change throughout the lifetime of a script, such as mathematical constants, configuration parameters, or error codes.

To define a constant in PHP, you can use the define() function. The first argument to define() is the name of the constant, and the second argument is its value. The name of the constant must start with a letter or underscore, and can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. The value can be of any data type, including integers, floats, strings, arrays, and objects.

Here's an example of defining a constant in PHP:

``` php
define("PI", 3.14);
```

Once a constant has been defined, you can access its value by simply referring to its name, without the leading dollar sign used for variables. For Example:

```php
$radius = 5;
$circumference = 2 * PI * $radius;
```

Note that constants defined using define() are global in scope, meaning that they can be accessed from anywhere in your script. Constants defined using const have the same behavior, but are defined differently.

```php
const PI = 3.14;
```
It's a good practice to define constants in uppercase letters, to distinguish them from variables.
