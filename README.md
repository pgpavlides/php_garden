### 1.2 Brief history of PHP? <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/2132/2132336.png" alt="image-description" height="40px" width="40px">

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language that is widely used for web development. It was created in 1994 by [Rasmus Lerdorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf), a Danish-Canadian programmer, as a set of Common Gateway Interface [CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) scripts to keep track of visitors to his personal website. Over time, Lerdorf extended the language and eventually released it as open-source software, which allowed others to contribute to its development.

In the late 1990s, two developers, [Andi Gutmans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andi_Gutmans) and [Zeev Suraski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeev_Suraski), rewrote the language's core, creating a more robust and efficient version of PHP. This version, known as PHP 3, was released in 1998 and became very popular among web developers.

Over the years, PHP has continued to evolve and improve, with the release of new versions that added new features and improved performance. The latest version of PHP, PHP 8, was released in November 2020 and includes features such as named arguments, union types, and attributes.

Today, PHP is used by millions of websites and is supported by a large and active community of developers. It is one of the most popular scripting languages for web development and is used to build dynamic and interactive websites, e-commerce sites, content management systems, and more.

# 3 Variables and Data Types

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8nwm1gq/Divider.png" width="100%" > 
</p>

### 3.1 Variables

All variables in PHP must be declared with a **leading dollar sign ($)**. For example, a string variable named "message" would be declared as follows:

```php
$message = "Hello, world!";
```



It's important to note that in PHP, variables are **dynamically typed**, which means that the type of a variable can change at runtime based on the value assigned to it.



- **Scalar variables**: These are variables that can hold a single value, such as an integer, float, string, or boolean.

```php
$integer = 42;
$float = 3.14;
$string = "Hello, world!";
$boolean = true;
```

- **Array variables**: These are variables that can hold multiple values, indexed either numerically or associatively.

```php
$numbers = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
$associative_array = array("one" => 1, "two" => 2, "three" => 3);
```

- **Object variables**: These are variables that hold instances of classes, which can contain both data and behavior.

```php
class Car {
    public $make;
    public $model;
    public $year;
}

$my_car = new Car();
$my_car->make = "Toyota";
$my_car->model = "Camry";
$my_car->year = 2020;
```

- **Resource variables**: These are special variables that hold references to resources external to PHP, such as database connections or file handles.

```php
$file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
$database = mysqli_connect("localhost", "user", "password", "database");
```

- **NULL variables**: These are variables that have no value assigned to them.
```php
$null_variable = null;
```

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8nwm1gq/Divider.png" width="100%" > 
</p>

### 3.2 Data types

- **Integers**: Represent whole numbers, such as 42 or -123.

```php
$a = 42;
$b = -123;
```

- **Floats**: Represent numbers with decimal places, such as 3.14 or -0.01.

```php
$c = 3.14;
$d = -0.01;
```

- **Strings**: Represent sequences of characters, such as "Hello, world!" or "php".
```php
$e = "Hello, world!";
$f = "php";
```


- **Booleans**: Represent truth values, either true or false.

```php
$g = true;
$h = false;
```

- **Arrays**: Represent ordered collections of values, either indexed by numbers (called numeric arrays) or by strings (called associative arrays).

```php
$numbers = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
$associative_array = array("one" => 1, "two" => 2, "three" => 3);
```

- **Objects**: Represent instances of classes, which can contain both data and behavior.

```php
class Car {
    public $make;
    public $model;
    public $year;
}

$my_car = new Car();
$my_car->make = "Toyota";
$my_car->model = "Camry";
$my_car->year = 2020;
```

- **Resources**: Represent external resources, such as database connections or file handles.

```php
$file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
$database = mysqli_connect("localhost", "user", "password", "database");
```

- **NULL**: Represent the absence of a value.

```php
$null_variable = null;
```

</p>

### 3.3 Type Casting

In PHP, type casting refers to the process of converting a value from one data type to another. This is sometimes necessary when working with values of different data types, such as when you need to perform arithmetic with a string that contains a number.

Type casting in PHP can be done either explicitly or implicitly. Explicit type casting is performed using type casting functions, such as (**int**), (**float**), (**string**), and (**bool**). For example:

```php
$a = (int) "42"; // $a will be an integer with the value 42
$b = (float) "3.14"; // $b will be a float with the value 3.14
$c = (string) 42; // $c will be a string with the value "42"
$d = (bool) 0; // $d will be a boolean with the value false
```

Implicit type casting occurs automatically in certain situations, such as when a value is used in a context that requires a different data type. For example:

```php
$a = 42;
$b = $a + 0.5; // $b will be a float with the value 42.5
$c = "42";
$d = $c + 0; // $d will be an integer with the value 42
```

It's important to be mindful of the data types of values when performing type casting, as the results of the conversion may not always be what you expect. For example, when casting a float to an integer, the fractional part of the float will be truncated, not rounded. When casting a string to a boolean, the string "false" (not including quotes) will be cast to false, while all other strings will be cast to true.

### 3.4 Constants

In PHP, constants are values that cannot be changed after they have been defined. Constants are typically used to represent values that don't change throughout the lifetime of a script, such as mathematical constants, configuration parameters, or error codes.

To define a constant in PHP, you can use the define() function. The first argument to define() is the name of the constant, and the second argument is its value. The name of the constant must start with a letter or underscore, and can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. The value can be of any data type, including integers, floats, strings, arrays, and objects.

Here's an example of defining a constant in PHP:

``` php
define("PI", 3.14);
```

Once a constant has been defined, you can access its value by simply referring to its name, without the leading dollar sign used for variables. For Example:

```php
$radius = 5;
$circumference = 2 * PI * $radius;
```

Note that constants defined using define() are global in scope, meaning that they can be accessed from anywhere in your script. Constants defined using const have the same behavior, but are defined differently.

```php
const PI = 3.14;
```
It's a good practice to define constants in uppercase letters, to distinguish them from variables.

# 4. Control Structures

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8nwm1gq/Divider.png" width="100%" > 
</p>

### 4.1 Conditionals (if, else, elseif)

In PHP, you can use conditionals to execute different blocks of code based on the value of one or more expressions. The most commonly used conditional statements are **if**, **else**, and **elseif**.

The **if statement** is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true. The syntax for an if statement is as follows:


```php
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if condition is true
}
```

For example:

```php
$a = 42;

if ($a > 0) {
    echo "$a is positive.";
}
```

The **else statement** is used to execute a block of code if the condition in the if statement is false. The syntax for an else statement is as follows:

```php
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if condition is false
}
```

For example:

```php
$a = -42;

if ($a > 0) {
    echo "$a is positive.";
} else {
    echo "$a is not positive.";
}
```

The **elseif statement** is used to test multiple conditions, and execute a different block of code for each condition that is true. The syntax for an elseif statement is as follows:

```php
if (condition1) {
    // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} elseif (condition2) {
    // code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if neither condition1 nor condition2 is true
}
```

For example:

```php
$a = 0;

if ($a > 0) {
    echo "$a is positive.";
} elseif ($a < 0) {
    echo "$a is negative.";
} else {
    echo "$a is zero.";
}
```

It's important to note that only one block of code will be executed for each set of conditions, and the first condition that is true will cause its corresponding code to be executed and any remaining conditions to be skipped.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8nwm1gq/Divider.png" width="100%" > 
</p>

### 4.2 Switch Statements



In PHP, the switch statement provides a convenient way to test a single expression against multiple possible values, and execute a block of code for each matching value. The switch statement is often used as an alternative to a series of if...elseif...else statements, when you need to test for many possible values of a single expression.

The syntax for a switch statement is as follows:

```php
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code to be executed if expression == value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code to be executed if expression == value2
        break;
    ...
    default:
        // code to be executed if no case matches the expression
        break;
}
```

For example:

```php
$day = "Monday";

switch ($day) {
    case "Monday":
        echo "Today is Monday.";
        break;
    case "Tuesday":
        echo "Today is Tuesday.";
        break;
    case "Wednesday":
        echo "Today is Wednesday.";
        break;
    ...
    default:
        echo "Today is not Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, ..., Sunday.";
        break;
}
```

It's important to note that the break statement is used to exit the switch statement after a matching case has been executed. If a break statement is omitted, the code in the next case will be executed as well, even if it doesn't match the expression. To avoid this behavior, you can use the break statement to explicitly exit the switch statement after a matching case has been executed. The default case is optional, and will be executed if no other case matches the expression.

# 5. Functions

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8nwm1gq/Divider.png" width="100%" > 
</p>

### 5.1 Defining Functions

In PHP, a function is a block of code that can be executed multiple times, and can accept input in the form of parameters, and return output in the form of a return value. Functions are useful for encapsulating and reusing code, and for organizing and simplifying complex scripts.

To define a function in PHP, you use the function keyword, followed by the name of the function, a list of parameters in parentheses, and a block of code inside curly braces. The syntax for defining a function in PHP is as follows:

```php
function function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
    // code to be executed when the function is called
}
```

For Example:

```php
function say_hello($name) {
    echo "Hello, $name!";
}
```

To call a function in PHP, you simply use its name, followed by a list of arguments in parentheses. The arguments should match the parameters defined in the function definition, in both number and data type.

For example:

```php
say_hello("John"); // outputs "Hello, John!"
```

Functions in PHP can also return a value using the return statement. The return statement is used to specify the value that should be returned by the function, and can be used anywhere in the function. When a return statement is executed, the function terminates immediately, and the value of the return statement is passed back to the calling code.

For example:

```php
function square($number) {
    return $number * $number;
}

$result = square(5); // $result will be 25
```

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8nwm1gq/Divider.png" width="100%" > 
</p>

### 5.2 Function Arguments

Function arguments are a fundamental aspect of functions in PHP, as they allow functions to accept input and operate on that input in order to produce output. Understanding function arguments is essential to writing effective and reusable functions in PHP.

Function arguments are defined in the function declaration as a comma-separated list of variables within parentheses, following the function name. These variables, known as parameters, serve as placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function when it is called.

For example, consider the following function definition:

```php
function add_numbers($a, $b) {
    return $a + $b;
}
```

In this example, the `add_numbers` function accepts two arguments, `$a` and `$b`, which are added together and returned as the result.

When calling a function, arguments are passed to the function by providing values in the same order as the parameters, separated by commas, inside the parentheses following the function name.

For example:
```php
$result = add_numbers(5, 7);
```

In this example, the values 5 and 7 are passed as arguments to the add_numbers function, and the result of the function, 12, is assigned to the variable $result.

It is also possible to provide default values for parameters in the function declaration, which will be used if the corresponding argument is not provided when the function is called. Default values are specified using the = operator, followed by the default value.

For example:

```php
function greet($name, $greeting = "Hello") {
    echo "$greeting, $name!";
}
```

In this example, the greet function accepts two arguments, $name and $greeting, where $greeting has a default value of "Hello". If the $greeting argument is not provided when the function is called, the default value will be used instead.

```php
greet("John"); // outputs "Hello, John!"
greet("Jane", "Hi"); // outputs "Hi, Jane!"
```


It's also possible to pass arguments to a function by reference, rather than by value. When an argument is passed by reference, any changes made to the argument within the function will affect the original value, rather than just a copy of the value. To pass an argument by reference, the argument must be prefixed with an ampersand (&) when calling the function.

For example:

```php
function double(&$number) {
    $number *= 2;
}

$a = 5;
double($a);
echo $a; // outputs 10

```

In this example, the `double` function accepts a single argument `$number`, which is passed by reference. The function multiplies the value of `$number` by 2, which updates the original value of `$a`.

In summary, **function arguments** provide a way for functions to accept **input**, and are an essential aspect of writing effective and reusable functions in PHP. Understanding how to define and use function arguments is key to writing effective PHP code.

### 5.3 Return Values

In PHP, the return statement is used to specify the value that should be returned by a function. The return statement is used to return a value from a function to the calling code, and can be used anywhere within the function.

When a return statement is executed, the function terminates immediately, and the value of the return statement is passed back to the calling code. The value that is returned can be of any data type, including scalar values (such as integers, floats, and strings), arrays, objects, and even other functions.

For example:

```php
function square($number) {
    return $number * $number;
}

$result = square(5); // $result will be 25
```

In this example, the ***square*** function accepts a single argument `$number`, and returns its square. The result of the function is assigned to the variable `$result`.

It's important to note that a function can return multiple values by returning an array or an object, or by using multiple return statements. However, in most cases, it is considered best practice to return a single value from a function, as this makes the function easier to understand and use.

The return statement is optional in a function, and if a function does not have a return statement, or if the return statement does not specify a value, then the function will return NULL by default.

For example:

```php
function do_something() {
    // perform some action
}

$result = do_something(); // $result will be NULL
```

In this example, the do_something function does not have a return statement, and therefore returns NULL by default.

### 5.4 Anonymous functions and closures

In PHP, anonymous functions, also known as closures, are functions that are not bound to an identifier. Anonymous functions are typically used as function arguments, and can be created using the function keyword, followed by a list of parameters in parentheses, and a block of code inside curly braces.

Here's an example of an anonymous function in PHP:

```php
$double = function ($number) {
    return $number * 2;
};

$result = $double(5); // $result will be 10
```

In this example, the anonymous function $double accepts a single argument $number, and returns its double. The result of the function is assigned to the variable $result.

Closures, or anonymous functions that can capture variables from the outer scope, are a powerful feature of PHP, and are used to create function objects that can be passed around and executed at a later time.

For example:

```php
$greet = function ($name) {
    return function ($greeting) use ($name) {
        return "$greeting, $name!";
    };
};

$hello = $greet("John");
echo $hello("Hello"); // outputs "Hello, John!"
```

In this example, the anonymous function `$greet` returns another anonymous function, which is assigned to the variable `$hello`. The returned anonymous function has access to the variable $name from the outer scope, and can use it in its implementation. The result of the returned anonymous function is a string, which is outputted when the function is executed.

Closures are a powerful feature of PHP, and are used extensively in functional programming, event-driven programming, and other advanced programming paradigms. Understanding closures and how to use them effectively is a key aspect of writing advanced PHP code.
