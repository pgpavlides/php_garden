### 1.2 Brief history of PHP? <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/2132/2132336.png" alt="image-description" height="40px" width="40px">

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language that is widely used for web development. It was created in 1994 by [Rasmus Lerdorf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmus_Lerdorf), a Danish-Canadian programmer, as a set of Common Gateway Interface [CGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface) scripts to keep track of visitors to his personal website. Over time, Lerdorf extended the language and eventually released it as open-source software, which allowed others to contribute to its development.

In the late 1990s, two developers, [Andi Gutmans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andi_Gutmans) and [Zeev Suraski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeev_Suraski), rewrote the language's core, creating a more robust and efficient version of PHP. This version, known as PHP 3, was released in 1998 and became very popular among web developers.

Over the years, PHP has continued to evolve and improve, with the release of new versions that added new features and improved performance. The latest version of PHP, PHP 8, was released in November 2020 and includes features such as named arguments, union types, and attributes.

Today, PHP is used by millions of websites and is supported by a large and active community of developers. It is one of the most popular scripting languages for web development and is used to build dynamic and interactive websites, e-commerce sites, content management systems, and more.

# 3 Variables and Data Types

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8nwm1gq/Divider.png" width="100%" > 
</p>

### 3.1 Variables

All variables in PHP must be declared with a **leading dollar sign ($)**. For example, a string variable named "message" would be declared as follows:

```php
$message = "Hello, world!";
```



It's important to note that in PHP, variables are **dynamically typed**, which means that the type of a variable can change at runtime based on the value assigned to it.



- **Scalar variables**: These are variables that can hold a single value, such as an integer, float, string, or boolean.

```php
$integer = 42;
$float = 3.14;
$string = "Hello, world!";
$boolean = true;
```

- **Array variables**: These are variables that can hold multiple values, indexed either numerically or associatively.

```php
$numbers = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
$associative_array = array("one" => 1, "two" => 2, "three" => 3);
```

- **Object variables**: These are variables that hold instances of classes, which can contain both data and behavior.

```php
class Car {
    public $make;
    public $model;
    public $year;
}

$my_car = new Car();
$my_car->make = "Toyota";
$my_car->model = "Camry";
$my_car->year = 2020;
```

- **Resource variables**: These are special variables that hold references to resources external to PHP, such as database connections or file handles.

```php
$file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
$database = mysqli_connect("localhost", "user", "password", "database");
```

- **NULL variables**: These are variables that have no value assigned to them.
```php
$null_variable = null;
```

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8nwm1gq/Divider.png" width="100%" > 
</p>

### 3.2 Data types

- **Integers**: Represent whole numbers, such as 42 or -123.

```php
$a = 42;
$b = -123;
```

- **Floats**: Represent numbers with decimal places, such as 3.14 or -0.01.

```php
$c = 3.14;
$d = -0.01;
```

- **Strings**: Represent sequences of characters, such as "Hello, world!" or "php".
```php
$e = "Hello, world!";
$f = "php";
```


- **Booleans**: Represent truth values, either true or false.

```php
$g = true;
$h = false;
```

- **Arrays**: Represent ordered collections of values, either indexed by numbers (called numeric arrays) or by strings (called associative arrays).

```php
$numbers = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
$associative_array = array("one" => 1, "two" => 2, "three" => 3);
```

- **Objects**: Represent instances of classes, which can contain both data and behavior.

```php
class Car {
    public $make;
    public $model;
    public $year;
}

$my_car = new Car();
$my_car->make = "Toyota";
$my_car->model = "Camry";
$my_car->year = 2020;
```

- **Resources**: Represent external resources, such as database connections or file handles.

```php
$file = fopen("example.txt", "r");
$database = mysqli_connect("localhost", "user", "password", "database");
```

- **NULL**: Represent the absence of a value.

```php
$null_variable = null;
```

</p>

### 3.3 Type Casting

In PHP, type casting refers to the process of converting a value from one data type to another. This is sometimes necessary when working with values of different data types, such as when you need to perform arithmetic with a string that contains a number.

Type casting in PHP can be done either explicitly or implicitly. Explicit type casting is performed using type casting functions, such as (**int**), (**float**), (**string**), and (**bool**). For example:

```php
$a = (int) "42"; // $a will be an integer with the value 42
$b = (float) "3.14"; // $b will be a float with the value 3.14
$c = (string) 42; // $c will be a string with the value "42"
$d = (bool) 0; // $d will be a boolean with the value false
```

Implicit type casting occurs automatically in certain situations, such as when a value is used in a context that requires a different data type. For example:

```php
$a = 42;
$b = $a + 0.5; // $b will be a float with the value 42.5
$c = "42";
$d = $c + 0; // $d will be an integer with the value 42
```

It's important to be mindful of the data types of values when performing type casting, as the results of the conversion may not always be what you expect. For example, when casting a float to an integer, the fractional part of the float will be truncated, not rounded. When casting a string to a boolean, the string "false" (not including quotes) will be cast to false, while all other strings will be cast to true.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8nwm1gq/Divider.png" width="100%" > 
</p>

### 3.4 Constants

In PHP, constants are values that cannot be changed after they have been defined. Constants are typically used to represent values that don't change throughout the lifetime of a script, such as mathematical constants, configuration parameters, or error codes.

To define a constant in PHP, you can use the define() function. The first argument to define() is the name of the constant, and the second argument is its value. The name of the constant must start with a letter or underscore, and can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. The value can be of any data type, including integers, floats, strings, arrays, and objects.

Here's an example of defining a constant in PHP:

``` php
define("PI", 3.14);
```

Once a constant has been defined, you can access its value by simply referring to its name, without the leading dollar sign used for variables. For Example:

```php
$radius = 5;
$circumference = 2 * PI * $radius;
```

Note that constants defined using define() are global in scope, meaning that they can be accessed from anywhere in your script. Constants defined using const have the same behavior, but are defined differently.

```php
const PI = 3.14;
```
It's a good practice to define constants in uppercase letters, to distinguish them from variables.

# 4. Control Structures

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8nwm1gq/Divider.png" width="100%" > 
</p>

### 4.1 Conditionals (if, else, elseif)

In PHP, you can use conditionals to execute different blocks of code based on the value of one or more expressions. The most commonly used conditional statements are **if**, **else**, and **elseif**.

The **if statement** is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true. The syntax for an if statement is as follows:


```php
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if condition is true
}
```

For example:

```php
$a = 42;

if ($a > 0) {
    echo "$a is positive.";
}
```

The **else statement** is used to execute a block of code if the condition in the if statement is false. The syntax for an else statement is as follows:

```php
if (condition) {
    // code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if condition is false
}
```

For example:

```php
$a = -42;

if ($a > 0) {
    echo "$a is positive.";
} else {
    echo "$a is not positive.";
}
```

The **elseif statement** is used to test multiple conditions, and execute a different block of code for each condition that is true. The syntax for an elseif statement is as follows:

```php
if (condition1) {
    // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} elseif (condition2) {
    // code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
    // code to be executed if neither condition1 nor condition2 is true
}
```

For example:

```php
$a = 0;

if ($a > 0) {
    echo "$a is positive.";
} elseif ($a < 0) {
    echo "$a is negative.";
} else {
    echo "$a is zero.";
}
```

It's important to note that only one block of code will be executed for each set of conditions, and the first condition that is true will cause its corresponding code to be executed and any remaining conditions to be skipped.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8nwm1gq/Divider.png" width="100%" > 
</p>

### 4.2 Switch Statements



In PHP, the switch statement provides a convenient way to test a single expression against multiple possible values, and execute a block of code for each matching value. The switch statement is often used as an alternative to a series of **if...elseif...else statements**, when you need to test for many possible values of a single expression.

The syntax for a switch statement is as follows:

```php
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code to be executed if expression == value1
        break;
    case value2:
        // code to be executed if expression == value2
        break;
    ...
    default:
        // code to be executed if no case matches the expression
        break;
}
```

For example:

```php
$day = "Monday";

switch ($day) {
    case "Monday":
        echo "Today is Monday.";
        break;
    case "Tuesday":
        echo "Today is Tuesday.";
        break;
    case "Wednesday":
        echo "Today is Wednesday.";
        break;
    ...
    default:
        echo "Today is not Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, ..., Sunday.";
        break;
}
```

It's important to note that the break statement is used to exit the switch statement after a matching case has been executed. If a break statement is omitted, the code in the next case will be executed as well, even if it doesn't match the expression. To avoid this behavior, you can use the break statement to explicitly exit the switch statement after a matching case has been executed. The default case is optional, and will be executed if no other case matches the expression.

</p>

### 4.3 Loops (for, while, do-while, foreach)

In PHP, loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until a specified condition is met. There are four main types of loops in PHP: for, while, do-while, and foreach. Here's a brief overview of each loop along with an example:

- **For loop**:
The for loop is used when you know how many times you want to execute the loop. It has three parts: an initialization expression, a condition, and an increment/decrement expression.

Example:

```php

for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
    echo "Iteration: $i\n";
}

```

- **While loop**:
The while loop executes a block of code as long as a given condition is true. If the condition is false initially, the loop body will not be executed.

Example:

```php
$count = 0;
while ($count < 5) {
    echo "Iteration: $count\n";
    $count++;
}

```

- **Do-while loop**:
The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but the loop body is executed at least once, because the condition is checked after the loop body is executed.

Example:

```php
$count = 0;
do {
    echo "Iteration: $count\n";
    $count++;
} while ($count < 5);
```

- **Foreach loop**:
The foreach loop is used to iterate through arrays or objects. It is particularly useful when working with associative arrays, as it provides an easy way to access both keys and values.

Example:

```php
$array = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
foreach ($array as $key => $value) {
    echo "Key: $key, Value: $value\n";
}
```

In this example, the foreach loop iterates through the $array and assigns the key and value of each element to the $key and $value variables respectively, which can then be used within the loop body.

# 5. Functions

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8nwm1gq/Divider.png" width="100%" > 
</p>

### 5.1 Defining Functions

In PHP, a function is a block of code that can be executed multiple times, and can accept input in the form of parameters, and return output in the form of a return value. Functions are useful for encapsulating and reusing code, and for organizing and simplifying complex scripts.

To define a function in PHP, you use the `function` keyword, followed by the `name of the function`, `a list of parameters in parentheses`, and a `block of code inside curly braces`. The syntax for defining a function in PHP is as follows:

```php
function function_name(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
    // code to be executed when the function is called
}
```

For Example:

```php
function say_hello($name) {
    echo "Hello, $name!";
}
```

To call a function in PHP, you simply use its name, followed by a list of arguments in parentheses. The arguments should match the parameters defined in the function definition, in both number and data type.

For example:

```php
say_hello("John"); // outputs "Hello, John!"
```

Functions in PHP can also return a value using the return statement. The return statement is used to specify the value that should be returned by the function, and can be used anywhere in the function. When a return statement is executed, the function terminates immediately, and the value of the return statement is passed back to the calling code.

For example:

```php
function square($number) {
    return $number * $number;
}

$result = square(5); // $result will be 25
```

Function arguments are a fundamental aspect of functions in PHP, as they allow functions to accept input and operate on that input in order to produce output. Understanding function arguments is essential to writing effective and reusable functions in PHP.

Function arguments are defined in the function declaration as a comma-separated list of variables within parentheses, following the function name. These variables, known as parameters, serve as placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function when it is called.

For example, consider the following function definition:

```php
function add_numbers($a, $b) {
    return $a + $b;
}
```

In this example, the `add_numbers` function accepts two arguments, `$a` and `$b`, which are added together and returned as the result.

When calling a function, arguments are passed to the function by providing values in the same order as the parameters, separated by commas, inside the parentheses following the function name.

For example:
```php
$result = add_numbers(5, 7);
```

In this example, the values 5 and 7 are passed as arguments to the add_numbers function, and the result of the function, 12, is assigned to the variable $result.

It is also possible to provide default values for parameters in the function declaration, which will be used if the corresponding argument is not provided when the function is called. Default values are specified using the = operator, followed by the default value.

For example:

```php
function greet($name, $greeting = "Hello") {
    echo "$greeting, $name!";
}
```

In this example, the greet function accepts two arguments, $name and $greeting, where $greeting has a default value of "Hello". If the $greeting argument is not provided when the function is called, the default value will be used instead.

```php
greet("John"); // outputs "Hello, John!"
greet("Jane", "Hi"); // outputs "Hi, Jane!"
```


It's also possible to pass arguments to a function by reference, rather than by value. When an argument is passed by reference, any changes made to the argument within the function will affect the original value, rather than just a copy of the value. To pass an argument by reference, the argument must be prefixed with an ampersand (&) when calling the function.

For example:

```php
function double(&$number) {
    $number *= 2;
}

$a = 5;
double($a);
echo $a; // outputs 10

```

In this example, the `double` function accepts a single argument `$number`, which is passed by reference. The function multiplies the value of `$number` by 2, which updates the original value of `$a`.

In summary, **function arguments** provide a way for functions to accept **input**, and are an essential aspect of writing effective and reusable functions in PHP. Understanding how to define and use function arguments is key to writing effective PHP code.

### 5.3 Return Values

In PHP, the return statement is used to specify the value that should be returned by a function. The return statement is used to return a value from a function to the calling code, and can be used anywhere within the function.

When a return statement is executed, the function terminates immediately, and the value of the return statement is passed back to the calling code. The value that is returned can be of any data type, including scalar values (such as integers, floats, and strings), arrays, objects, and even other functions.

For example:

```php
function square($number) {
    return $number * $number;
}

$result = square(5); // $result will be 25
```

In this example, the ***square*** function accepts a single argument `$number`, and returns its square. The result of the function is assigned to the variable `$result`.

It's important to note that a function can return multiple values by returning an array or an object, or by using multiple return statements. However, in most cases, it is considered best practice to return a single value from a function, as this makes the function easier to understand and use.

The return statement is optional in a function, and if a function does not have a return statement, or if the return statement does not specify a value, then the function will return NULL by default.

For example:

```php
function do_something() {
    // perform some action
}

$result = do_something(); // $result will be NULL
```

In this example, the do_something function does not have a return statement, and therefore returns NULL by default.

</p>

### 5.4 Anonymous functions and closures

In PHP, anonymous functions, also known as **closures**, are functions that are not bound to an identifier. Anonymous functions are typically used as function arguments, and can be created using the function keyword, followed by a list of parameters in parentheses, and a block of code inside curly braces.

Here's an example of an anonymous function in PHP:

```php
$double = function ($number) {
    return $number * 2;
};

$result = $double(5); // $result will be 10
```

In this example, the anonymous function $double accepts a single argument $number, and returns its double. The result of the function is assigned to the variable $result.

Closures, or anonymous functions that can capture variables from the outer scope, are a powerful feature of PHP, and are used to create function objects that can be passed around and executed at a later time.

For example:

```php
$greet = function ($name) {
    return function ($greeting) use ($name) {
        return "$greeting, $name!";
    };
};

$hello = $greet("John");
echo $hello("Hello"); // outputs "Hello, John!"
```

In this example, the anonymous function `$greet` returns another anonymous function, which is assigned to the variable `$hello`. The returned anonymous function has access to the variable $name from the outer scope, and can use it in its implementation. The result of the returned anonymous function is a string, which is outputted when the function is executed.

Closures are a powerful feature of PHP, and are used extensively in functional programming, event-driven programming, and other advanced programming paradigms. Understanding closures and how to use them effectively is a key aspect of writing advanced PHP code.

# 6. Arrays

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8nwm1gq/Divider.png" width="100%" > 
</p>



### 6.1 Indexed Arrays

Indexed arrays in PHP are arrays with numeric indexes, starting from 0. They can store values in a sequential manner, making them suitable for lists or collections of similar items. To create an indexed array, you can either use the array() function or the short array syntax []. Here's an example of how to create, manipulate, and loop through an indexed array in PHP:

``` php
<?php
// Creating an indexed array using the array() function
$fruits = array("apple", "banana", "cherry");

// Creating an indexed array using the short array syntax
$colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

// Accessing elements in an indexed array by index
echo $fruits[0]; // Output: apple
echo $colors[2]; // Output: blue

// Modifying elements in an indexed array
$fruits[1] = "mango";
$colors[0] = "yellow";

// Adding elements to an indexed array
$fruits[] = "orange"; // Appends "orange" to the end of the array
$colors[3] = "purple"; // Adds "purple" at index 3

// Looping through an indexed array using a for loop
for ($i = 0; $i < count($fruits); $i++) {
    echo $fruits[$i] . "\n"; // Output: apple, mango, cherry, orange
}

// Looping through an indexed array using a foreach loop
foreach ($colors as $color) {
    echo $color . "\n"; // Output: yellow, green, blue, purple
}
?>
```

In this example, we create two indexed arrays: `$fruits` and `$colors`. We demonstrate how to access, modify, and add elements to these arrays. Finally, we show how to loop through the arrays using both **for** and **foreach** loops.

### 6.2 Associative Arrays

In PHP, associative arrays are implemented using arrays. Unlike indexed arrays, which use numerical indices, associative arrays use string keys to map to their corresponding values. You can create an associative array using the array() construct or the short syntax []. Here are some examples of associative arrays in PHP:

1. Creating an associative array:

``` php
// Using array() construct
$phone_book = array(
    'Alice' => '555-1234',
    'Bob' => '555-5678',
    'Charlie' => '555-2468'
);

// Using short syntax []
$phone_book = [
    'Alice' => '555-1234',
    'Bob' => '555-5678',
    'Charlie' => '555-2468'
];

```
2. Adding a new entry:

```php
$phone_book['David'] = '555-1357';
```

3. Accessing a value by key:

```php
echo $phone_book['Alice']; // Output: '555-1234'
```

4. Iterating through an associative array:

```php
foreach ($phone_book as $name => $phone_number) {
    echo $name . ": " . $phone_number . "\n";
}
```

This would output:
```php
Alice: 555-1234
Bob: 555-5678
Charlie: 555-2468
David: 555-1357
```

5. Checking if a key exists:

```php
if (array_key_exists('Alice', $phone_book)) {
    echo "Alice's phone number is " . $phone_book['Alice'] . "\n";
} else {
    echo "Alice's phone number is not in the phone book.\n";
}

```

These examples demonstrate how to create, add, access, iterate, and check for the existence of keys in associative arrays in PHP.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8nwm1gq/Divider.png" width="100%" > 
</p>

### 6.3 Multidimensional Arrays

Multidimensional arrays in PHP are arrays that contain other arrays as their elements. These nested arrays can be indexed or associative, and can be used to represent complex data structures like tables or matrices. Multidimensional arrays can have multiple levels of depth, but the most common type is the two-dimensional array.

Here's an example of a two-dimensional indexed array representing a matrix:


```php
$matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
];

```

In this example, $matrix is an array containing three arrays, each with three elements.

You can also create multidimensional associative arrays. Here's an example of a two-dimensional associative array representing user data:


```php
$users = [
    'Alice' => [
        'age' => 30,
        'email' => 'alice@example.com'
    ],
    'Bob' => [
        'age' => 25,
        'email' => 'bob@example.com'
    ],
    'Charlie' => [
        'age' => 35,
        'email' => 'charlie@example.com'
    ]
];
```

In this example, $users is an associative array where each key maps to another associative array containing user data.

To access elements in a multidimensional array, you can use multiple indices or keys:

```php
echo $matrix[0][1]; // Output: 2
echo $users['Alice']['email']; // Output: alice@example.com

```

You can also iterate through a multidimensional array using nested loops. For indexed arrays:

```php
for ($i = 0; $i < count($matrix); $i++) {
    for ($j = 0; $j < count($matrix[$i]); $j++) {
        echo $matrix[$i][$j] . ' ';
    }
    echo "\n";
}
```

For associative arrays:

```php
foreach ($users as $name => $user_data) {
    echo $name . ":\n";
    foreach ($user_data as $key => $value) {
        echo "  " . $key . ": " . $value . "\n";
    }
}
```

These examples demonstrate how to create, access, and iterate through multidimensional arrays in PHP. Multidimensional arrays are a powerful tool for organizing and manipulating complex data structures in your PHP applications.

### 6.4 Array Functions

PHP provides a wide range of built-in array functions for various operations on arrays. Here's a list of some of the most common array functions in PHP:


| Function Name           | Description                                               |

# 7. Strings

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8nwm1gq/Divider.png" width="100%" > 
</p>

### 7.1 String basics

In PHP, strings are sequences of characters used to represent text. They can be created using either single quotes (') or double quotes ("), and they have some important differences in how they are interpreted:

- **Single-quoted strings**: These strings are interpreted literally, meaning that any escape sequences (except for \' and \\) will not be processed. Variables inside single-quoted strings will not be expanded.

```php
$string1 = 'Hello, my name is $name.';
echo $string1; // Output: Hello, my name is $name.

```

- **Double-quoted strings**: These strings are more flexible, as they can interpret escape sequences (like \n for newline or \t for tab) and expand variables within the string.

```php
$name = 'Alice';
$string2 = "Hello, my name is $name.";
echo $string2; // Output: Hello, my name is Alice.
```

You can also create strings using the heredoc and nowdoc syntax, which are useful for defining multi-line strings:

- **Heredoc**: Similar to double-quoted strings, heredoc syntax supports escape sequences and variable interpolation.

```php
$string3 = <<<EOT
Hello, my name is $name.
This is a multi-line string.
EOT;

echo $string3;
```

- **Nowdoc**: Similar to single-quoted strings, nowdoc syntax does not process escape sequences or variables.

String manipulation and functions are an essential part of PHP programming. Some common string functions include:

| Function Name             | Description                                                    |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| strlen($string)           | Returns the length of the string.                              |
| strpos($haystack, $needle)| Finds the position of the first occurrence of a substring in a string. |
| substr($string, $start, $length) | Returns a part of a string.                                 |
| str_replace($search, $replace, $subject) | Replaces all occurrences of a search value with a replacement value in a string. |
| strtolower($string)       | Converts a string to lowercase.                                |
| strtoupper($string)       | Converts a string to uppercase.                                |
| trim($string)             | Strips whitespace (or other characters) from the beginning and end of a string. |


Here's an example of using some of these string functions:

```php
$string = "  Hello, my name is Alice.  ";
$length = strlen(trim($string));
$lowercase = strtolower($string);
$uppercase = strtoupper($string);
$replaced = str_replace("Alice", "Bob", $string);

echo $length . "\n"; // Output: 20
echo $lowercase . "\n"; // Output: "  hello, my name is alice.  "
echo $uppercase . "\n"; // Output: "  HELLO, MY NAME IS ALICE.  "
echo $replaced . "\n"; // Output: "  Hello, my name is Bob.  "
```

These are some of the basics of strings in PHP, including how to create, manipulate, and use them in various ways.

### 7.2 String manipulation



| Function Name             | Description                                                    | Code Example                                     |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| strlen($string)           | Returns the length of the string.                              | `echo strlen("Hello, World!"); // Output: 13`    |
| strpos($haystack, $needle)| Finds the position of the first occurrence of a substring in a string. | `echo strpos("Hello, World!", "World"); // Output: 7` |
| substr($string, $start, $length) | Returns a part of a string.                                 | `echo substr("Hello, World!", 7, 5); // Output: "World"` |
| str_replace($search, $replace, $subject) | Replaces all occurrences of a search value with a replacement value in a string. | `echo str_replace("World", "PHP", "Hello, World!"); // Output: "Hello, PHP!"` |
| strtolower($string)       | Converts a string to lowercase.                                | `echo strtolower("Hello, World!"); // Output: "hello, world!"` |
| strtoupper($string)       | Converts a string to uppercase.                                | `echo strtoupper("Hello, World!"); // Output: "HELLO, WORLD!"` |
| trim($string)             | Strips whitespace (or other characters) from the beginning and end of a string. | `echo trim("   Hello, World!   "); // Output: "Hello, World!"` |

### 7.3 Regular expressions

Regular expressions, often abbreviated as regex, are a powerful tool for pattern matching and manipulation of strings in PHP. They allow you to perform complex searches, validate input, replace substrings, and much more.

In PHP, regular expressions are implemented using the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) library, which provides functions such as `preg_match()`, `preg_match_all()`, `preg_replace()`, `preg_replace_callback()`, and `preg_split()`.

Here's an overview of some common PHP regex functions:

- `preg_match($pattern, $subject, $matches)`: Searches a string `$subject` for a match to the regular expression `$pattern`. If a match is found, it returns 1, otherwise 0. If the optional $matches parameter is provided, it will be filled with the results of the search.

```php
$pattern = '/world/i'; // Case-insensitive search for the word "world"
$subject = 'Hello, World!';
$result = preg_match($pattern, $subject, $matches);
echo $result; // Output: 1
print_r($matches); // Output: Array ( [0] => World )
```

- `preg_match_all($pattern, $subject, $matches)`: Searches a string `$subject` for all matches to the regular expression `$pattern` and puts them in the `$matches` array.

```php
$pattern = '/\d+/'; // Matches one or more digits
$subject = 'There are 3 cats and 5 dogs.';
$result = preg_match_all($pattern, $subject, $matches);
echo $result; // Output: 2
print_r($matches); // Output: Array ( [0] => Array ( [0] => 3 [1] => 5 ) )
```

- `preg_replace($pattern, $replacement, $subject)`: Searches a string `$subject` for matches to the regular expression `$pattern` and replaces them with the `$replacement`.

```php
$pattern = '/\s+/'; // Matches one or more whitespace characters
$replacement = '-';
$subject = 'This is a string with spaces.';
$result = preg_replace($pattern, $replacement, $subject);
echo $result; // Output: "This-is-a-string-with-spaces."
```

- `preg_replace_callback($pattern, $callback, $subject)`: Searches a string `$subject `for matches to the regular expression `$pattern` and replaces them with the result of calling the `$callback` function on the matches.

```php
$pattern = '/\d+/';
$subject = 'There are 3 cats and 5 dogs.';

$result = preg_replace_callback($pattern, function ($matches) {
    return $matches[0] * 2;
}, $subject);

echo $result; // Output: "There are 6 cats and 10 dogs."
```

`preg_split($pattern, $subject)`: Splits a string `$subject` by a regular expression `$pattern`.

```php
$pattern = '/\s+/'; // Matches one or more whitespace characters
$subject = 'This is a string with spaces.';
$result = preg_split($pattern, $subject);
print_r($result); // Output: Array ( [0] => This [1] => is [2] => a [3] => string [4] => with [5] => spaces. )
```

These functions are the most common tools for working with regular expressions in PHP. Regular expressions are a powerful way to search, replace, and manipulate strings based on complex patterns, which can be particularly useful for tasks like input validation, text processing, and data extraction.

# 8. Object-Oriented PHP

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8nwm1gq/Divider.png" width="100%" > 
</p>

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design and implement software. PHP supports OOP features, allowing developers to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

Here are some key OOP concepts in PHP:

- **Classes**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure). It defines properties (attributes) and methods (functions) that are common to all objects of that class.

```php
class Person {
    public $name;
    public $age;

    public function greet() {
        return "Hello, my name is " . $this->name . " and I am " . $this->age . " years old.";
    }
}
```

- **Objects**: An object is an instance of a class. It has its own set of properties and methods defined by its class.

```php
$alice = new Person();
$alice->name = 'Alice';
$alice->age = 30;

echo $alice->greet(); // Output: "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old."

```

- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data (properties) and methods that operate on the data within a single unit (class). It is used to hide the internal implementation details and expose only what is necessary.

```php
class BankAccount {
    private $balance;

    public function __construct($initialBalance) {
        $this->balance = $initialBalance;
    }

    public function deposit($amount) {
        $this->balance += $amount;
    }

    public function withdraw($amount) {
        if ($amount <= $this->balance) {
            $this->balance -= $amount;
            return $amount;
        }
        return 0;
    }

    public function getBalance() {
        return $this->balance;
    }
}
```

- **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class. The class that inherits is called the subclass (or derived class), and the class being inherited from is called the superclass (or base class).

```php
class Employee extends Person {
    public $position;

    public function greet() {
        return parent::greet() . " I work as a " . $this->position . ".";
    }
}

$bob = new Employee();
$bob->name = 'Bob';
$bob->age = 25;
$bob->position = 'developer';

echo $bob->greet(); // Output: "Hello, my name is Bob and I am 25 years old. I work as a developer."
```

- **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is the ability of different classes to implement the same interface or extend the same base class while providing their own implementation for the inherited methods.

```php
interface Shape {
    public function area();
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    private $radius;

    public function __construct($radius) {
        $this->radius = $radius;
    }

    public function area() {
        return pi() * pow($this->radius, 2);
    }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    private $width;
    private $height;

    public function __construct($width, $height) {
        $this->width = $width;
        $this->height = $height;
    }

    public function area() {
        return $this->width * $this->height;
    }
}
```

These concepts form the basis of OOP in PHP. Using OOP can help you create structured, flexible, and maintainable code for your PHP applications.

### 8.1 Classes and Objects

In PHP, classes and objects are fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). They allow you to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

**Classes**: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, which are instances of the class. It defines properties (attributes) and methods (functions) that are common to all objects of that class.

Here's an example of a class in PHP:

```php
class Person {
    public $name;
    public $age;

    public function greet() {
        return "Hello, my name is " . $this->name . " and I am " . $this->age . " years old.";
    }
}
```

In this example, `Person` is a class with two properties (`$name` and `$age`) and one method (`greet()`). The `public` keyword indicates the visibility of the properties and method, meaning they can be accessed from outside the class.

**Objects**: An object is an individual instance of a class, created using the `new` keyword. An object has its own set of properties and methods defined by its class.

Here's an example of creating an object and using its properties and methods:

```php
$alice = new Person(); // Create a new object of the Person class
$alice->name = 'Alice'; // Set the name property of the alice object
$alice->age = 30; // Set the age property of the alice object

echo $alice->greet(); // Call the greet() method on the alice object and output the result
// Output: "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old."
```

In this example, `$alice` is an object of the `Person` class. We set the `name` and `age` properties and call the `greet()` method on the object.

In summary, classes and objects are the building blocks of OOP in PHP. Classes define the structure and behavior of objects, while objects are individual instances of classes with their own properties and methods. Using classes and objects can help you write more organized, modular, and maintainable code in your PHP applications.

### 8.2 Properties and methods

In the context of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), classes are blueprints for creating objects. Classes can have properties and methods, which define the state and behavior of the objects created from those classes.

**Properties** (also known as attributes or fields) represent the state or data of an object. They store values that are specific to each object created from a class. Properties can have different visibility levels (public, protected, and private) that determine the scope of access for that property.

**Methods** (also known as functions) represent the behavior or actions of an object. They are used to manipulate the object's properties or perform some operation on the object's data. Like properties, methods can also have different visibility levels (public, protected, and private).

Here's an example of a simple class in PHP with properties and methods:

```php
class Dog {
    // Properties
    public $name;
    public $breed;
    private $age;

    // Constructor to initialize properties
    public function __construct($name, $breed, $age) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->breed = $breed;
        $this->age = $age;
    }

    // Method to get the dog's age
    public function getAge() {
        return $this->age;
    }

    // Method to set the dog's age
    public function setAge($age) {
        if ($age >= 0) {
            $this->age = $age;
        }
    }

    // Method to make the dog bark
    public function bark() {
        echo "Woof! Woof!";
    }
}
```

In the example above:

- The `Dog` class has three properties: `$name`, `$breed`, and `$age`. The `$name` and `$breed` properties are public, while the `$age` property is private.
- The `__construct()` method is a special method called the constructor, which is called when a new object is created. In this case, it initializes the properties of the `Dog` class.
- The `getAge()` and `setAge($age)` methods are public methods used to get and set the value of the `$age` property.
- The `bark()` method is a public method that makes the dog "bark" by printing "Woof! Woof!" to the output.

You can create objects from the `Dog` class and interact with its properties and methods like this:

```php
$dog1 = new Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever", 3);
echo $dog1->name; // Output: "Buddy"
echo $dog1->getAge(); // Output: 3
$dog1->setAge(4);
echo $dog1->getAge(); // Output: 4
$dog1->bark(); // Output: "Woof! Woof!"
```

In summary, properties and methods are essential parts of classes in OOP. They define the state and behavior of objects created from those classes, allowing you to encapsulate data and functionality within objects.

### 8.3 Inheritance

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows you to create a new class, called a child class, that inherits properties and methods from an existing class, known as the parent class. This promotes code reusability and modularity, making it easier to maintain and extend the functionality of a program. PHP, being an OOP language, supports inheritance.

Here's a brief overview of inheritance in PHP:

**1. Parent class**: The parent class is the original class that you want to inherit from. It can have properties (variables) and methods (functions) that the child class can access and use.

**2. Child class**: The child class is the new class that inherits from the parent class. It can access the parent class's properties and methods (except private ones), and it can also have its own properties and methods.

To create a child class that inherits from a parent class in PHP, you can use the extends keyword:

```php
class ParentClass {
  protected $property;

  public function parentMethod() {
    // Some code here
  }
}

class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
  public function childMethod() {
    // This class can access $property and parentMethod() from ParentClass
  }
}
```

In the example above, `ChildClass` inherits from `ParentClass`. The child class can access the parent class's `$property` and `parentMethod()` as long as they are declared as `public` or `protected`. Note that private properties and methods are not accessible to child classes.

Additionally, PHP supports the following concepts in inheritance:

**1. Overriding**: Child classes can override parent class methods by declaring a method with the same name. The child class's implementation will be used instead of the parent class's implementation when the method is called on an object of the child class.

```php
class ParentClass {
  public function exampleMethod() {
    echo "This is the parent class method.";
  }
}

class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
  public function exampleMethod() {
    echo "This is the child class method, overriding the parent class method.";
  }
}

$child = new ChildClass();
$child->exampleMethod(); // Outputs: "This is the child class method, overriding the parent class method."
```

**2. Calling parent class methods**: If you want to call a parent class method from within a child class while also having an overridden method, you can use the `parent` keyword followed by the scope resolution operator `::`.

```php
class ParentClass {
  public function exampleMethod() {
    echo "This is the parent class method.";
  }
}

class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
  public function exampleMethod() {
    parent::exampleMethod(); // Call the parent class's method
    echo " This is the child class method.";
  }
}

$child = new ChildClass();
$child->exampleMethod(); // Outputs: "This is the parent class method. This is the child class method."
```
**3. Abstract classes**: Abstract classes are classes that cannot be instantiated on their own and serve as a blueprint for other classes. They can have abstract methods that must be implemented by any non-abstract child class that extends the abstract class. Abstract classes are declared with the abstract keyword.

``` php
abstract class AbstractClass {
  abstract public function abstractMethod();
}

class Concrete
Class extends AbstractClass {
public function abstractMethod() {
echo "This is the concrete implementation of the abstract method.";
}
}

// $abstractInstance = new AbstractClass(); // Not allowed, results in an error
$concreteInstance = new ConcreteClass();
$concreteInstance->abstractMethod(); // Outputs: "This is the concrete implementation of the abstract method."
```

 **4. Interfaces**: Interfaces are similar to abstract classes in that they cannot be instantiated, but they only contain method signatures without any implementation. A class can implement multiple interfaces, whereas it can only extend a single parent class. Interfaces are declared with the `interface` keyword, and a class implements an interface using the `implements` keyword.

```php
interface ExampleInterface {
  public function exampleMethod();
}

class ImplementingClass implements ExampleInterface {
  public function exampleMethod() {
    echo "This is the implementation of the exampleMethod in ImplementingClass.";
  }
}

$implementingInstance = new ImplementingClass();
$implementingInstance->exampleMethod(); // Outputs: "This is the implementation of the exampleMethod in ImplementingClass."
```

In conclusion, inheritance in PHP allows you to create a hierarchical structure of classes that share properties and methods, promoting code reusability and modularity. You can extend parent classes, override and call parent methods, use abstract classes as blueprints, and implement interfaces to define a set of methods a class must have.
